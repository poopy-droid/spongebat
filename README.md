# spongebat
play spongebob from cmd (customizable)
To customize, replace series URL 
and numpages
and the special char replacement as needed
see documentation  in the .bat 

ps: to continue the autoplay you need to close the player window

tested while stoned 
it was easy hassle free a little too much info* but i put it on autoplay

*too much episodes

thanks for the idea to https://github.com/trakBan/spongebob-cli
